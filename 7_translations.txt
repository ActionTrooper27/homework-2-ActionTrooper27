Suppose you have the following propositional atoms:

p: It is sunny tomorrow
q: I will go hiking
r: I carry an umbrella
s: I am tired
t: I eat an apple


Express each of these propositional logic statements in English as
succinctly as you can.


Statement 1: ¬p → r ∧ ¬q

If it is not sunny tomorrow, then I carry an umbrella and will not go hiking.



Statement 2: ¬(r ∨ t) → ¬q

I will not carry an umbrella and will not eat an apple, then I will go hiking.


Statement 3: ¬s → (p → q)

I am not tired, then since it is sunny tomorrow, I will go hiking.
