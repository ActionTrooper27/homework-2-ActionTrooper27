Circuit problem 1:

Draw a picture (as described below) of the following circuit:

(p OR NOT q) AND (NOT p OR q)





Circuit problem 2:

Draw a picture (as described below) of the following circuit:

NOT(p AND NOT q) OR NOT(NOT p AND r)


Instructions to include your circuits:

Either draw BOTH circuits on the same paper or using a drawing tool. Label which circuit
is which. Create the file 1_circuitsPic.png (or 1_circuitsPic.jpg) that contains a picture
of both circuits. Add that picture file to your hw2 repository's src directory.

You should see the picture file appear under src in the project view to the left. It will
be colored in red since it is not part of your repository. Right-click the name of the picture
file and select "Git-->Add". It should then be colored green, and will be committed with
the rest of your changes when you commit/push.
