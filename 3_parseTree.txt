Draw a parse tree for the following formula:

¬p ∧ q ∧ r → ¬p ∨ ¬q ∧ r



Instructions to include your parse tree:

Either draw the parse tree on paper or using a drawing tool. Create the file
3_treePic.png (or 3_treePic.jpg) that contains a picture of your parse tree.
Add that picture file to your hw2 repository's src directory.

You should see the picture file appear under src in the project view to the left. It will
be listed in red since it is not part of your repository. Right-click the name of the picture
file and select "Git-->Add". It should then be colored green, and will be committed with
the rest of your changes when you commit/push.
