For each of the following propositional logic statements, write either "satisfiable"
or "not satisfiable". If a statement is satisfiable, include a truth assignment
that demonstrates your claim. (You do not need to complete a full truth table.)



Sat problem 1:
(p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (¬p ∨ q) ∧ (¬p ∨ ¬q)

Satisfiable.
q = false
p = false

Sat problem 2:
(p ∨ q ∨ r) ∧ (¬p ∨ ¬q ∨ r) ∧ (p ∨ ¬q ∨ ¬r) ∧ (¬p ∨ q ∨ ¬r)

Satisfiable:
p = true
q = true
r = true


Sat problem 3:
(p → q) ∧ (q → p) ∧ (¬p → q) ∧ (q → ¬p)

Satisfiable:
p = true
q = true
r = true


Sat problem 4:
(p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (p ∨ q) ∧ (¬p ∨ ¬q) ∧ (¬p ∨ q)

Not satisfiable :(
