In class, we demonstrated DeMorgan's laws for propositional logic.


DeMorgan's problem 1:

Use DeMorgan's laws to write an if-statement whose condition is the
negation of the condition in the if-statement below. Write your
if-statement in such a way that it does not use any ! (not) symbols.

if (a != 7 && str.contains(piece) == true) {
    //statements
}


Negated condition:


if (a == 7 && str.contains(piece) == false) {
    // statements
}




DeMorgan's problem 2:

Use DeMorgan's laws to write an if-statement whose condition is the
negation of the condition in the if-statement below. Write your
if-statement in such a way that it does not use any ! (not) symbols.

if (val < 45 || nums.length <= 10) {
    //statements
}

Negated condition:

if (val >= 45 || nums.length > 10) {
    // statements
}

DeMorgan's problem 3:

Apply DeMorgan's laws multiple times to write an if-statement whose condition is the
negation of the condition in the if-statement below. Write your
if-statement in such a way that it does not use any ! (not) symbols.

if ((score >= 90 && score <= 100) || (s.quizOut() == true && level > 4) {
    //statements
}

Negated condition:

if ((score < 90 || score > 100) && (s.quizOut() == false || level <= 4)) {
    // statements
}
